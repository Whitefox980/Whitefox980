## 🐺 What is Shadow OS? 
---

## 📢 Public Release

I’ve decided to make all of my **ethical hacking** repositories publicly available — including the Shadow OS project, fuzzers, reconnaissance tools, and AI analyzers across **all 26 repos**.

These tools were built for research, digital forensics, and recovery of lost digital artifacts.  
**Use them responsibly and carefully.**  
I do not take responsibility for any unauthorized or illegal use.

---

**Shadow OS** was a long‑term cybersecurity and digital forensics initiative — an experimental OS concept for deep reconnaissance, threat detection, and digital artifact recovery.  
It combined open‑source tools, custom scripts, and AI‑driven analysis to:

- 🔍 Scan old dumps, forums, and `.db` files for lost Bitcoin addresses, private keys, and digital footprints.  
- ⚔️ Identify and assess security threats and vulnerabilities across legacy platforms.  
- 🕵️ Operate as a digital archaeological workspace for extracting forgotten or overlooked digital artifacts.

**Shadow OS** acted as a foundation for projects like `bitcoin1` — a toolbox for digital archaeology and recovery, preserving and exploring the hidden layers of early internet and crypto history.
